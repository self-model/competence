### Power Analysis for the Study

A pilot study was conducted on 100 participants. However, no indication of significant results were found. Therefore, the pilot study does not inform the power analysis. 

Instead, the power analysis will be used to calculate how many participants will be required from a within-subject repeated measures test for 95% power and an effect size of 0.4. 

```{r}
 pwr.t.test(d = 0.4, sig.level = 0.05 , power = 0.95, type = c("paired"))
```

For a small effect size, 84 pairs would be required. This would require 168 participants in total. 


We decide instead to recruit 100 pairs of participants, or 200. 

```{r}
pwr.t.test(n = 200, power = 0.95, sig.level = 0.05, type = "paired")
```
